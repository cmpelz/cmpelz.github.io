I am always struck at museums with visitors use of cameras and insistence upon taking pictures of the art hanging on the wall. Many people have realized that simply taking a picture of the art is unnecessary because of the bounty of high-resolution images of said pieces available online. In order, then to make the picture more interesting and unique, people pose in front of the art so the photo contains themselves as well. However, this incites a new problem where people vie to get there chance to pose in front of the work, all the while disrupting other viewers attempts to engage with it undisturbed. During our time at WCMA, I noticed that people’s primary means of engagement with the art involved standing right in front of it and gazing for extended periods of time. Imagine attempting this kind of pensive contemplation with other visitors constantly stepping in front of the work to take hurried pictures at odd angles. The problem then, is to design a means of taking a photo with the art which multiple people can do at once and which doesn’t disturb the experience of other visitors.

The solution I propose is to develop a program where visitors could pull up a preexisting image of the piece of art (presumably from the museum’s database), and superimpose an image of themselves into the work of art. Not only would this help to solve the problem of keeping a view of the work unobstructed, but it would be a fun and exciting new way to engage with art. 

Maybe you put your face on the “Mona Lisa”, or position yourself floating through “Starry Night”, or perhaps you place yourself in the costumes on display in the “Dance We Must” exhibit in WCMA. Whatever the case may be, this design would provide an interesting alternative to waiting your turn to take a photo in front of the art that would be fun for all ages. I could envision this design particularly taking hold amongst young kids for whom this would offer a way to keep them entertained while also helping them engage with the art.
