A summary of all the heuristic evaluations:

The following adjustments to the paper prototype for the mobile app reflect the desire for a "way out" from every screen, as reflected by small x's in the corners of pop-up windows, and back arrows in the corner of every screen.

Additionally, the first five photos reflect the users' desire for guidance from the home menu.

Some of the notes from the evaluations do not feel necessary to address at this point. For instance, we feel the feedback concerning confusion surrounding the logo will be resolved when the actual logo is displayed (this is just a rough sketch). Additionally, feedback would be given after taking a photo through the functionality of the camera in the actual design (similar to how a typial phone camera signals when a photo has been taken).
