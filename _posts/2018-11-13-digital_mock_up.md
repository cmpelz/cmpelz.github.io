##### Difficulties
During our mock-up process we encountered a number of small difficulties that required minute adjustments.  We added a home button, using a house icon, to the top right corner of every screen to allow the user the ability to return to the home screen at any time.  We also toggled with the color scheme and use of white space in order to best direct the user to important design and functionality components and not overcrowd the screen.
