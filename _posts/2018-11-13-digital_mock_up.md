### Digital Mock-Up Overview

##### Difficulties
During our mock-up process we encountered a number of small difficulties that required minute adjustments.  We added a home button, using a house icon, to the top right corner of every screen to allow the user the ability to return to the home screen at any time.  We also toggled with the color scheme and use of white space in order to best direct the user to important design and functionality components and not overcrowd the screen.

### Task 1: Agency in one's museum experience

The user turns on "Tracking" and clicks "Remember a Piece".  At any time the user can hit the back arrow to return to the previous screen or the home icon to return to this home screen.

The user can either snap a picture or "See Similar Pieces".

If the user chooses to "See Similar Pieces," then they select what interests them.

Whether the user took their own picture or selected another piece, they now have multiple options.

If the user chooses to share it, they can do so via email or text.

If they choose to see routes that include this piece, they are presented with multiple routes.

Upon choosing an interesting route, the user can share it or go to other similar routes (the previous screen).

The user can once again share their route via text or email.



### Task 2: Continued engagement with the users favorite or most memorable pieces
