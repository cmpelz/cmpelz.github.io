### Usability Tests Overview
The three usability tests all took place in the same environment: a quiet, distraction-free room in Science Quad. This was done partially to try to keep testing environments consistent to eliminate confounding variables, and because the first test was successful in this environment so we opted to reuse it. A link to a description of the first test can be found [here](https://cmpelz.github.io/2018-11-05-usability_checkin/). After this first test, we changed our prototype drastically, removing the kiosk entirely and moving its functionality onto the app. For our second test, we had AA, a college student who is interested in art and museums, utilize our app under minimal constraints. We gave them a brief overview of the appâ€™s purpose then simply prompted them to explore the app as they saw fit all while pretending to be wandering through WCMA. This lack of direction was actually very helpful in that it revealed some core misunderstandings in the purpose of our app. After this feedback, we decided to provide our next subject, AB with slightly more information so that we could actually gauge functionality and effectiveness of our app. AB is a community member (not a student) who is similarly interested in art, but is not well-versed in technology. Before beginning the test, we gave AB an overview of the functions the app provided, then let them explore freely with the intention of discovering and completing the various tasks of the app. In all three tests Casey acted as the app, switching the screens etc., while Sam took notes and prompted the user when necessary.
