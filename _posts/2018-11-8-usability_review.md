### Usability Tests Overview
The three usability tests all took place in the same environment: a quiet, distraction-free room in Science Quad. This was done partially to try to keep testing environments consistent to eliminate confounding variables, and because the first test was successful in this environment so we opted to reuse it. A link to a description of the first test can be found [here](https://cmpelz.github.io/2018-11-05-usability_checkin/). After this first test, we changed our prototype drastically, removing the kiosk entirely and moving its functionality onto the app. For our second test, we had AA, a college student who is interested in art and museums, utilize our app under minimal constraints. We gave them a brief overview of the app’s purpose then simply prompted them to explore the app as they saw fit all while pretending to be wandering through WCMA. This lack of direction was actually very helpful in that it revealed some core misunderstandings in the purpose of our app. After this feedback, we decided to provide our next subject, AB with slightly more information so that we could actually gauge functionality and effectiveness of our app. AB is a community member (not a student) who is similarly interested in art, but is not well-versed in technology. Before beginning the test, we gave AB an overview of the functions the app provided, then let them explore freely with the intention of discovering and completing the various tasks of the app. In all three tests Casey acted as the app, switching the screens etc., while Sam took notes and prompted the user when necessary. 

### AA Usability Test
##### Incident 1, Severity 3
It took AA a while to begin tracking their route because they were confused by the burron “Route Options”. They thought this button might lead them to possible routes they could follow through the museum, instead of allowing them to begin tracking their route. Despite the help window that pops up, they still expressed great hesitation in pressing the button, resulting in not tracking their route from the beginning. The resolution to this incident is really quite simple. Instead of leading to a page with more options, the button will simply say “Start Tracking Route”, making it clear what the user is meant to do. Upon clicking the button, it’s label will switch to “Stop Tracking Route” so that users can ignore it until they finish their visit.

##### Incident 2, Severity 1
When given the option to share things such as routes or pieces of art, AA expressed that they don’t really have any interest in sharing with people that aren’t with them in the exhibit. While this may just be a personal preference (in which case we would still leave the sharing option), it did alert us to another potential change to make. Because AA wasn’t interested in sharing, she never pressed the button on the home screen labeled “Share/Save/Print Your Route”, which in turn kept her from printing or saving her route which may be of more interest. Given this aversion to sharing, we decided to relabel the button “Remember Your Route” which we hope will encourage people to click on that option and in turn leave their visit with some memento of their route, which is ultimately one of our main goals with the app.

Updated Home Menu as a result of the two above incidents:
