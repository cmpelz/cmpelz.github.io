As Williams students, especially those of us who live in dorms and/or are on the meal plan, it is important to always have our student ID's with us. Some people carry them around in their wallets or on large clucky keychains, but that requires the extra thought and space of carrying an additional item they might not have otherwise needed. However, one thing that almost every college student carries with them religiously is their cellphone. This is the fundamental reason why the card sleeves that stick on the backs of cellphones are such good design.

Not only do they allow students to mindlessly tote their cards with them wherever they go, but they are incredibly well designed and functional. The sleeves are simply made out of rubber, allowing them to be cheap and accessible to college students on a budget. Additionally, they are small and sleek, eliminating the cumbersome trait of other cellphone wallet options. They are easy to apply and remove, can hold multiple cards, and the cards never fall out of them but are still easy to remove. Overall, they are incredibly functional, intuitive, and achieve a much needed task.

When it comes to aesthetic value, some are better than others. However, one of their greatest design traits is that they can be customized and come in many different designs. This affords users the ability to find the sleeve that perfectly matches their aesthetic desires, and allows companies and organizations to use them as an advertising tool.
