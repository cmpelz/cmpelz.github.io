### Discovering works that otherwise would have been overlooked 
#### *Easy - New* 

Ben doesn’t go to museums often and feels very out of touch with the world of art appreciation. When he goes to a museum, he is often drawn most to the famous pieces everyone is crowding around, or the more unconventional pieces, like WCMA’s “Our Love is Bigger than and AIDS Quilt” that have extra-visual elements that draw him in. He thinks he may like some of the other pieces in the museum, but he just doesn’t know how to find the ones he may really like, and often gets tired and loses motivation before completing a tour of the every exhibit. He’s tried asking museum staff where he could find pieces he’s likely to enjoy; however, he has a lot of trouble describing to them what these pieces may look like, so they generally can’t offer very helpful advice. 

### Conveying personal artistic preferences 
#### *Hard - New*

Greg loves visiting museums and finding new objects to think about and engage with – he also has a personal passion for computer science and a deep love of medieval poetry, among other unique interests. When he visits a new museum, he thinks about his various passions and makes connections between objects and ideas. He wants a more concrete way to connect his interests, academic and personal, to his experiences engaging with art. Greg wants to find connections between his interests and his favorite artists and styles (Dalí, surrealism, abstract, Rothko, colors, etc.) to discover new art and interests based not only on his aesthetic tastes but also his passions for code and the poems of Marie de France. When he finally makes it through WCMA’s doors, he comes armed with pictures of certain pieces that are on display and some obscure works from the collection that have piqued his interest – he knows where to go and what to look for. This helps him connect his unique personality and interests to the objects and spirit of WCMA. He makes a beeline for the Object Lab and begins reading the descriptions for courses, smiling to himself as he sees other unique connections to art across academic disciplines.

### Learning about the curator’s perspective and vision for the exhibit 
#### *Easy - Existing* 
Olivia is an art buff and knows every piece of art by its time period, medium, and artist before ever stepping foot in the museum.  Her curiosity stems from how the art is spatially combined, setup, and displayed.  She wants to know how light, sound, and even air temperature are manipulated for each piece and various exhibits as a whole.  In short, it has always been Olivia’s dream to be a curator, but weekend visits to WCMA will have to do.  She knows that pieces, museums, and collections are sometimes put together to be interpreted be each person differently and have no set meaning, but nonetheless, Olivia is interested in how professionals in the field have viewed, envisioned, and curated the art.  She wants to gain a more in depth understanding and appreciation for each museum she visits.  Unfortunately, most curators aren’t on site for chats or tours.  Even at places like WCMA, where the combination of academics and art is part of the mission, it’s not always possible for Olivia to satisfy her intellectual curiosity in a single daily visit.

### Continued engagement with the users favorite or most memorable pieces 
#### *Moderate - New*
Cal is someone who enjoys visiting museums, but he doesn’t get to do it all that often.  Being in his second year at Williams and hearing so much about WCMA from various friends, he decides to go one afternoon.  After looking through a particular exhibit, Cal realizes how applicable a series of photographs are to one of his current classes.  He knows he has to right a research paper at the end of the semester that incorporates non-text based sources.  He reads the description of the photos and tells himself he’ll remember in a few weeks.  As the paper due date approaches, Cal returns to WCMA with a notebook to do some brainstorming for a rough draft only to find that the exhibit has been switched and the pictures now replaced by a series of sculptures that don’t relate at all to his work.  He doesn’t have the time to sift through the online collection and can’t remember which exact photos he was looking at to ask the museum staff.  He wishes he had somehow “bookmarked” those pieces for himself and was able to retrieve them now. 

### Learning more about the collection as a whole
#### *Moderate - Existing* 

Sarah is in town to check out the Williamstown museums. She first visits the Clark and MassMoCA and is impressed with their large collection on display. Upon completing her final visit of the weekend to WCMA, she realizes she really liked the diverse collection on display, but was sad she didn’t get to see more pieces. She tries going on the WCMA website to see if they perhaps have a digital inventory of their full collection. She finds that they do have such a thing, but gets quickly overwhelmed by the incredible number of pieces. Feeling lost, she tries narrowing it down with the search bar, but is still forced to scroll through pages of works she’s not interested before finding one she really likes. Once she gets home from her trip, a friend asks her if she liked WCMA’s public art pieces scattered across the campus. Sarah laments that she didn’t even know there was public art to be seen, and feels like she missed out on a big part of WCMA’s collection.

### Agency in one’s museum experience 
#### *Hard - Existing* 

Leora does the same thing every time she goes to WCMA to see the latest exhibition – she goes upstairs, walks through each gallery with a meandering, listless gait and then goes downstairs to check out the Object Lab and any special works on display. This time, she thinks, she will take more initiative – she will have an active visit and her experience will be defined by her and her unique interests. She walks through the door and is instantly befuddled by the pink column with arrows pointing five different ways – should she go upstairs or downstairs, left or right? She doesn't know what is currently on display and feels at a loss. Resigned, she goes upstairs and begins looking at every work, one by one, and feels robotic. Leora wishes there were some way to plan her experience beforehand so that she could more dynamically find, engage with, and remember works that are meaningful to her. She just wants to give herself a unique experience with art without falling into the same old patterns.
