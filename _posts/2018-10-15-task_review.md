### Discovering works that otherwise would have been overlooked 
#### *Easy - New* 

Ben doesn’t go to museums often and feels very out of touch with the world of art appreciation. When he goes to a museum, he is often drawn most to the famous pieces everyone is crowding around, or the more unconventional pieces, like WCMA’s “Our Love is Bigger than and AIDS Quilt” that have extra-visual elements that draw him in. He thinks he may like some of the other pieces in the museum, but he just doesn’t know how to find the ones he may really like, and often gets tired and loses motivation before completing a tour of the every exhibit. He’s tried asking museum staff where he could find pieces he’s likely to enjoy; however, he has a lot of trouble describing to them what these pieces may look like, so they generally can’t offer very helpful advice. 

### Conveying personal artistic preferences 
#### Hard - New

Greg loves visiting museums and finding new objects to think about and engage with – he also has a personal passion for computer science and a deep love of medieval poetry, among other unique interests. When he visits a new museum, he thinks about his various passions and makes connections between objects and ideas. He wants a more concrete way to connect his interests, academic and personal, to his experiences engaging with art. Greg wants to find connections between his interests and his favorite artists and styles (Dalí, surrealism, abstract, Rothko, colors, etc.) to discover new art and interests based not only on his aesthetic tastes but also his passions for code and the poems of Marie de France. When he finally makes it through WCMA’s doors, he comes armed with pictures of certain pieces that are on display and some obscure works from the collection that have piqued his interest – he knows where to go and what to look for. This helps him connect his unique personality and interests to the objects and spirit of WCMA. He makes a beeline for the Object Lab and begins reading the descriptions for courses, smiling to himself as he sees other unique connections to art across academic disciplines.

Sarah is in town to check out the Williamstown museums. She first visits the Clark and MassMoCA and is impressed with their large collection on display. Upon completing her final visit of the weekend to WCMA, she realizes she really liked the diverse collection on display, but was sad she didn’t get to see more pieces. She tries going on the WCMA website to see if they perhaps have a digital inventory of their full collection. She finds that they do have such a thing, but gets quickly overwhelmed by the incredible number of pieces. Feeling lost, she tries narrowing it down with the search bar, but is still forced to scroll through pages of works she’s not interested before finding one she really likes. Once she gets home from her trip, a friend asks her if she liked WCMA’s public art pieces scattered across the campus. Sarah laments that she didn’t even know there was public art to be seen, and feels like she missed out on a big part of WCMA’s collection.

### Agency in one’s museum experience 
#### Hard - Existing 

Leora does the same thing every time she goes to WCMA to see the latest exhibition – she goes upstairs, walks through each gallery with a meandering, listless gait and then goes downstairs to check out the Object Lab and any special works on display. This time, she thinks, she will take more initiative – she will have an active visit and her experience will be defined by her and her unique interests. She walks through the door and is instantly befuddled by the pink column with arrows pointing five different ways – should she go upstairs or downstairs, left or right? She doesn't know what is currently on display and feels at a loss. Resigned, she goes upstairs and begins looking at every work, one by one, and feels robotic. Leora wishes there were some way to plan her experience beforehand so that she could more dynamically find, engage with, and remember works that are meaningful to her. She just wants to give herself a unique experience with art without falling into the same old patterns.
