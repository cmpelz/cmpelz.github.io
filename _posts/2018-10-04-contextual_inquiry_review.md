# **Summary of Key Findings**


We performed three contextual inquiries that incorporated the perspectives of a stakeholder in WCMA, a student who works at WCMA and therefore has a considerable amount of knowledge on WCMA’s collection, and a first year student who had never visited the museum.  The contextual inquiries took aim at dissecting how a museum is set up to engage with its visitors and operate as a physical space versus how museum visitors interact with, navigate, and experience the museum.  Each visitor, employee, or mix of the two brings their own perspective not only to WCMA as an institution, but also to the art within its walls.  Our contextual inquiries gave insight into the similarities and differences of these users, showing that optimizing the experience for visitors starts with blending all three parties’ perspectives.  Some interviewees focused more heavily on the artwork, some on the physical space, and others on the flow from piece to piece and exhibit to exhibit.  To optimize a visitor’s experience, we will focus in on the factors that make WCMA unique as a museum and how personal preferences lend themselves to overall experience, yielding a design that best serves each user as well as WCMA collectively. 


# **Design Research Goals, Users, and Stakeholders**


For our first three contextual inquiries, we chose three different Williams community members, each with varying levels of familiarity with the museum. RL is a student that is not at all familiar with WCMA, but has worked at a museum before. NS is a student who has worked at WCMA and is very familiar with it as a result. NP is a full-time staff member at WCMA who is both intimately familiar with the art and the museum’s visitors. While these three don’t necessarily represent our typical user, they do help us to better understand the problem our design is attempting to solve. We anticipate our typical user will be a visitor who may or may not be familiar with WCMA’s collection, but is likely not an employee of the museum.

RL is first year student who is not familiar with the works of art in the WCMA collection or the layout of the museum, however she is familiar with museums more broadly as she has worked in one previously.  She represents a user who is unfamiliar with the physical space, but has an idea of how to approach the museum as a whole.  Her prior job had been to take museum tours and evaluate them based on a number of criteria.  This means that RL has a strong background in understanding the flow of museums, features of the space, stylistic preferences of curators, and overall knowledge on various types of art.  I asked her to walk around the museum as she would any other, point out any features she found interesting, curious, or that stood out.  In following her around I asked her about some of her behaviors, choices to look at certain are, and path taken.  She had deep insight not only the experience as a visitor, but also as a knowledgeable member of the museum community.  She focused on the physical placement of pieces in the room, lighting, and flow between exhibits.  She also described her personal preference on how pieces and exhibits were described in words either on the wall or small plaques.  RL was an invaluable interviewee as her insight was able to blend the step by step process of navigating a museum while also keeping the big structure of the museum in mind.

NS is a senior Art History major at Williams College who spent a summer working at WCMA and now continues to work part time for them. She is an interesting subject because she represents both a visitor and stakeholder of the museum. We met in the WCMA lobby, and I asked her to just wander the museum exactly as she normally would. She led me around the museum, and we discussed different aspects of her visit as the arose. At the end of the inquiry, we sat in the Reading Room on the second floor, as NS always does, and discussed some of the insight she has as an employee of the museum. While she represents a visitor intimately familiar with the museum, and thus without need of guidance, she did offer good insight into the knowledge other visitors come in with, such as the fact that many people know little to nothing about the museum’s public art collection or architecture of the building itself.

NP is a stakeholder in WCMA with a vested interest in visitor engagement. Her job is focused on academic and public engagement; as a result, she is an expert on these topics at WCMA. We met in her office where I asked her a series of probing questions about her process and about the kinds of things she thinks about at WCMA, while visiting other museums, and while designing projects and programs for visitor engagement. I then asked her to take me on a typical walk through the museum and she suggested that she bring me on a tour as though I were a visitor that she was introducing to WCMA’s spaces and the many programs there that facilitate visitors’ interactions with the collection and space. NP expressed how WCMA is meant to be a space where visitors of all kinds can learn and focused on facilities and programs such as the Rose Gallery, the Art Department offices, the student-selected installation of Our Love is Bigger Than an AIDS Quilt, and the Object Lab. I asked probing questions about how these programs relate to the collection as a whole and how they are made to apply to both students and the general public alike, to which NP was very responsive and informative regarding steps taken by WCMA stakeholders to improve engagement with the general public as well as with students. When prompted, NP also discussed the problem with wayfinding at the WCMA entrance and different strategies employed by the museum to combat this problem such as a section of wall with arrows pointing to different parts of the museum and ideas for an interpretive map of the museum and collection.

# **Task Analysis**

### *Who is going to use the design?*
  * Our design is available and accessible to any and all users of a museum, including all age ranges and persons with varying degrees of   museum or art expertise.  It is aimed at individuals currently planning a trip to a museum as well as for visitors once they arrive to the museum.
  
### *What tasks do they now perform?*
  * Currently, our users visit museums. They walk in the front doors, choose a direction to move in, then begin their traversal of the museum. As they move through the exhibits, they wander around the rooms, looking at the art, pausing longer at those pieces that pique their interest. Given that WCMA is small, our users generally leave after they’ve seen the whole thing, and notably don’t explore WCMA’s virtual collection or visit its public art with any sort of intentionality.

### *What tasks are desired?*

  * Ideally, the user would have a plan for their visit to the museum, ensuring they visited every piece they would like. The task then, would be to create a route that brought the visitor to all the pieces they were likely to enjoy. This includes, identifying the user’s preferences, directing them to pieces pieces that match said preferences, and introducing them to WCMA’s digital collection, so that they are able to enjoy art that matches their tastes, regardless of whether it is currently hanging on the wall.

### *How are the tasks learned?*

  * The tasks are learned through guidance built into the product. As the user engages with the product, they will be continually prompted what to do, such that they don’t have to go out of their way to learn how to perform the tasks, and ideally might not even know they are learning. Additionally, there has to be a means for the user to learn that the product is available to them. This could be achieved through in museum advertisement, as well as publicity on WCMA’s website and social media platforms.

### *Where are the tasks performed?*

  * The tasks are performed either in WCMA or at users convenience outside of the museum before their visit. Some of the tasks, such as taking the preferences quiz, or exploring the virtual collection could occur separately. However, the main task of guiding users around the museum, and tracking their preferences as they go, will occur within WCMA.

### *What is the relationship between the person and data?*

  * The person should relate to data as though they were reading a map or guidebook meant to inspire and personalize a new or repeated experience – that is, the person will use the design to help them navigate not only WCMA’s hallways but also the broader collection as a whole, including objects not on the walls. Stakeholders will find that data provides meaningful insights into the interests, behaviors, movement, curiosity, and engagement of museum visitors.

### *What other tools does the person have?*

  * The person’s other tools include the publicly available WCMA Collection API, which represents a virtual cataloguing of almost the entirety of WCMA’s collection and includes a search function. In lieu of a museum map, visitors might notice a wall by the entrance with arrows pointing to the different parts of the museum (offices, Object Lab, restrooms, exhibition galleries, etc.). Additionally, the person may approach any staff members at WCMA, including the host at the front desk, to ask any questions they may have or simply to express their interest or curiosity in the museum and its collection.

### *How do people communicate with each other?*

  * Communication at museums occurs verbally and non-verbally – visitors communicate their feedback, curiosities, and overall engagement with objects and spaces through their interaction and movement while stakeholders communicate through iterative projects that attempt to gauge public response. In our design, people can communicate their reactions to suggested paths through WCMA and to suggested works in the collection by rating and commenting on paths or works.

### *How often are the tasks performed?*

  * The tasks are performed either before arriving to the exam or throughout a users visit to the museum.  Ideally a user would complete a survey or identify the pieces they would like to view, which creates a path for them.  The second option, which can pair with the first, is for visitors to perform tasks as they go, in which case a path is built for them based off of their preferences so far in the museum.  Optimally, tasks are performed once before arrival, and then continually throughout one’s visit.

### *What are the time constraints on the tasks?*

  * The time constraints for the tasks would be user driven.  Once a user entered their preferences, the design would immediately return to them a personalized path.  In this way, the user is free to explore the museum at their own leisure, taking as long or as short as they prefer.
 
### *What happens when things go wrong?*

  * In the case that things go wrong, for example a user doesn’t like their path, their path is taking too long, or they just wish to see new pieces, the user will have the ability to clear their preferences and start from scratch at any time.  This can either clear their pre-selected criteria and/or build a new path as they further explore the museum.
