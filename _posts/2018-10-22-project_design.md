	We have chosen to combine Designs 1 and 2 (with a little bit of 3) to create a mobile app that works in conjunction with kiosks located throughout the museum to support the tasks of planning, saving, and sharing bespoke route maps, which visitors can design themselves or with the help of prompts on the app and/or kiosks. Combining these designs eliminates possible problems for visitors in their museum experiences – by stationing kiosks in the reading room, by the entrance, and by couches in areas in between exhibition halls, visitors will be able to focus fully on works when they are viewing exhibitions and can interact with the collection as a whole and the creative route building process when they are in between galleries. This will prevent people from being glued to their screens while enjoying the museum (a potential pitfall of using only a mobile app) but will also afford many new possibilities in terms of accomplishing our tasks (with use of more versatile technology than a simply web app or stationary kiosk on its own): increasing agency in one’s museum experience and giving the opportunity to learn about the curator’s perspective and vision for the exhibits. We feel that giving visitors more agency in their experiences captures the type of experience we are aiming to give our users: we want each museum visit to be meaningful and memorable in a way that is specific to an individual visitor. Enriching visitors’ understanding of the vision and perspectives of curators will make them better equipped to fully utilize their newfound agency and will also contribute to making the museum experience more personally significant and memorable. By affording new functionalities such as designing, printing, or digitally saving custom route maps of their museum visits as well as learning more about the collection from the kiosks, visitors will have complete control over their visit, will be able to bring home a unique souvenir designed especially for them and by them, and will have immediate access to information that will enrich their experience.
