### Design Choice

We have chosen to combine Designs 1 and 2 (with a little bit of 3) to create a mobile app that works in conjunction with kiosks located throughout the museum to support the tasks of planning, saving, and sharing bespoke route maps, which visitors can design themselves or with the help of prompts on the app and/or kiosks. Combining these designs eliminates possible problems for visitors in their museum experiences – by stationing kiosks in the reading room, by the entrance, and by couches in areas in between exhibition halls, visitors will be able to focus fully on works when they are viewing exhibitions and can interact with the collection as a whole and the creative route building process when they are in between galleries. This will prevent people from being glued to their screens while enjoying the museum (a potential pitfall of using only a mobile app) but will also afford many new possibilities in terms of accomplishing our tasks (with use of more versatile technology than a simply web app or stationary kiosk on its own): increasing agency in one’s museum experience and giving the opportunity to learn about the curator’s perspective and vision for the exhibits. We feel that giving visitors more agency in their experiences captures the type of experience we are aiming to give our users: we want each museum visit to be meaningful and memorable in a way that is specific to an individual visitor. Enriching visitors’ understanding of the vision and perspectives of curators will make them better equipped to fully utilize their newfound agency and will also contribute to making the museum experience more personally significant and memorable. By affording new functionalities such as designing, printing, or digitally saving custom route maps of their museum visits as well as learning more about the collection from the kiosks, visitors will have complete control over their visit, will be able to bring home a unique souvenir designed especially for them and by them, and will have immediate access to information that will enrich their experience.

### Agency in one’s museum experience

This scenario demonstrates how the mobile app and kiosks would be used in tandem to personalize the user’s visit. By having the app open in the background on their phone, the user’s route through the museum would be constantly tracked. Along the way, they would stop at kiosks, strategically placed in areas absent of art, that could offer suggestions of pieces to go visit. As they make their way through the exhibits, users will use the camera in the app to “take pictures” of pieces they liked. These preferences would be saved then uploaded to the kiosks by scanning a QR code, thus allowing the system to build a preference profile for the user and offer more personalized advice. At the end of the visit, the user will stop at the final kiosk where they’ll have the option to share or save their route, as well as print a souvenir postcard of their favorite piece of the day.

### Learning about the curator’s perspective and vision for the exhibit

This scenario shows the path of a user as they attempt to learn more about the curation steps and processes used in WCMA’s exhibits. It begins with a user arriving to the museum and opening the SWCMA app.  Since they want to learn about curation, they will go ahead to the marked curation kiosk (a kiosk that functions like all the others but houses the curation info as well). They will then scan and download to the SWCMA app a “Curation Guide” for any or all exhibits. If they complete the whole guide in the app, then they are rewarded with a sticker or pin from the gift shop!
