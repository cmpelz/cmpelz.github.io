#### Cognitive Walk-Through
Task: Curator Notifications
Step: Expand Notification
Issues: Conceptual model, Labeling
Severity: 2
Details: Currently the label says "pull down for more options", but when you pul down you are brought to a screen entitled "More Info", which we anticipate being very confusing.
Revisions: The "pull down for more options" tab will be relabeled to say "pull down for more info"


Task: Curator Notifications
Step: Share
Issues: Visibility, Labeling, Feedback
Severity: 4
Details: At the bottom of the curator notification, there's a button to share the notification; however, at this point it's pretty unclear what it means to "share", in terms of what you would share and with whom. Additionally, there is no screen in the paper prototype that walks you through the action of sharing (aka putting in the information of the user you want to share with and through which medium).
Revisions: The "share" button will have more information about what it means to share. A page will be created to do the actual sharing.


Task: Like/Dislike a Piece
Step: Like/Dislike
Issues: Concpetual model, Feedback
Severity: 1
Details: The "Like/Dislike" button does not make it clear what you're liking or disliking, and no feedback is given when the user's inut has been received.
Revisions: The "Like/Dislike" button will be revised to have more information, and a pop-up window will provide feedback upon registering input.
