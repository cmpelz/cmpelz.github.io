#### Cognitive Walk-Through
Task: Curator Notifications

Step: Expand Notification

Issues: Conceptual model, Labeling

Severity: 2

Details: Currently the label says "pull down for more options", but when you pul down you are brought to a screen entitled "More Info", which we anticipate being very confusing.

Revisions: The "pull down for more options" tab will be relabeled to say "pull down for more info".

Task: Curator Notifications

Step: Share

Issues: Visibility, Labeling, Feedback

Severity: 4

Details: At the bottom of the curator notification, there's a button to share the notification; however, at this point it's pretty unclear what it means to "share", in terms of what you would share and with whom. Additionally, there is no screen in the paper prototype that walks you through the action of sharing (aka putting in the information of the user you want to share with and through which medium).

Revisions: The "share" button will have more information about what it means to share. A page will be created to do the actual sharing.

Task: Like/Dislike a Piece

Step: Like/Dislike

Issues: Concpetual model, Feedback

Severity: 1

Details: The "Like/Dislike" button does not make it clear what you're liking or disliking, and no feedback is given when the user's inut has been received.

Revisions: The "Like/Dislike" button will be revised to have more information, and a pop-up window will provide feedback upon registering input.
