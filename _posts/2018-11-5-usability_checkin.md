### Cognitive Walk-Through

##### Task: Curator Notifications

__Step:__ Expand Notification

__Issues:__ Conceptual model, Labeling

__Severity:__ 2

__Details:__ Currently the label says "pull down for more options", but when you pul down you are brought to a screen entitled "More Info", which we anticipate being very confusing.

__Revisions:__ The "pull down for more options" tab will be relabeled to say "pull down for more info".

##### Task: Curator Notifications

__Step:__ Share

__Issues:__ Visibility, Labeling, Feedback

__Severity:__ 4

__Details:__ At the bottom of the curator notification, there's a button to share the notification; however, at this point it's pretty unclear what it means to "share", in terms of what you would share and with whom. Additionally, there is no screen in the paper prototype that walks you through the action of sharing (aka putting in the information of the user you want to share with and through which medium).

__Revisions:__ The "share" button will have more information about what it means to share. A page will be created to do the actual sharing.

##### Task: Like/Dislike a Piece

__Step:__ Like/Dislike

__Issues:__ Concpetual model, Feedback

__Severity:__ 1

__Details:__ The "Like/Dislike" button does not make it clear what you're liking or disliking, and no feedback is given when the user's inut has been received.

__Revisions:__ The "Like/Dislike" button will be revised to have more information, and a pop-up window will provide feedback upon registering input.

### Usability Test Overview
Our first usability test was performed on 11/5/18 with a Williams student who we will refer to as JJ. We chose JJ because they represent what will likely be a large portion of our users: Williams College students. Additionally, JJ is familiar with operating mobile apps and technology like ours, but is unfamiliar with the design process or technology production in general. This was important to us, because we felt it would provide more realistic feedback and create a more authentic user experience. The test was conducted in a quiet, distraction-free room in Science Quad so that we could ensure JJ would stay focussed on the task at hand and thus perform as realistically as possible. Additionally, we chose a quiet space to imitate the natural ambiance of a museum, like WCMA.


#### Incident 1, Severity 4
When the user was asked to use our design to review a piece and learn more about curatorial information regarding the museum exhibition, she was confused by the kiosks and did not know what they were for, how to use them, or how they could help her achieve this task. This is an issue that became apparent as early as our heuristic evaluations in class and one that we have discussed as a group numerous times â€“ while we had initially hoped that the kiosks would help make the experience of using our design more unique while encouraging museum goers to get off their phones, it has become clear the kiosks are both confusing and redundant. As such, this issue has been resolved by eliminating the kiosks from our design and including their functionality (with some improvements) in the mobile app itself. Below are images of the new SWCMA app home screen, as well as the pages that allow users to access the information previously available on the kiosks.
